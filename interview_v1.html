Long-term, I aspire to become a proficient full-stack developer and a certified expert in the ServiceNow ecosystem, contributing to large-scale projects and mentoring others.' },
        { id: 'hr6', question: 'What are your weaknesses?', answer: 'I sometimes get too focused on the details of a project, which can make me lose track of the bigger picture. To counter this, I\'ve started using project management tools to better organize my tasks and visualize the overall progress, ensuring I meet deadlines and stay aligned with the project\'s main goals.' },
        { id: 'hr7', question: 'How do you handle pressure?', answer: 'I believe pressure can be a great motivator. I handle it by prioritizing my tasks, breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps, and communicating proactively with my team to manage expectations. This approach helps me stay calm and deliver quality work even under tight deadlines.' },
        { id: 'hr8', question: 'What motivates you?', answer: 'I am motivated by a combination of challenging projects and the opportunity for continuous learning. I enjoy solving complex problems and am always seeking to expand my technical skill set. Working on projects that have a tangible impact, like the Magno Charge project, is also a great source of motivation for me.' },
        { id: 'hr9', question: 'Why are you the best candidate for this job?', answer: 'My unique blend of hands-on experience in full-stack development, cloud technologies like Azure AI, and my proactive pursuit of professional certifications like ServiceNow CSA and CAD make me a strong candidate.

        { id: 'hr10', question: 'Where do you see yourself in five years?', answer: 'In five years, I see myself as a senior developer or a team lead, having mastered full-stack technologies and the ServiceNow platform. I hope to be a key contributor to innovative projects, mentoring junior developers, and continuing to learn and adapt to new technologies.' },
        { id: 'hr11', question: 'How do you stay updated with industry trends?', answer: 'I regularly follow tech blogs, subscribe to industry newsletters, and participate in online courses and workshops, like the ones I\'ve attended on Integrative AI in Web & App Development. I also stay active on platforms like GitHub to see what new technologies and projects are emerging.' },
        { id: 'hr12', question: 'How do you handle conflict in a team?', answer: 'I believe open and respectful communication is key. I would first try to understand the other person\'s perspective by listening carefully. Then, I would propose a solution-oriented discussion to find common ground and resolve the issue constructively, always keeping the project\'s success as the primary goal.' },
        { id: 'hr13', question: 'Tell me about your most successful project.', answer: 'My most successful project has been "Magno Charge," an intelligent auto disconnect charger. My team and I secured ₹4.8 Lakhs in funding from IIT Bombay\'s TIH-IoT Foundation. We developed a Bluetooth-enabled prototype to address the problem of battery overcharging. The success wasn\'t just in the funding, but in the collaborative problem-solving and tangible results we achieved as a team.' },
        { id: 'hr14', question: 'What is your GPA and what does it say about you?', answer: 'My GPA is 7.9/10, which corresponds to 75%. I believe it reflects a strong foundation in my academic studies. However, I believe my resume shows that I am not just focused on academics, but also on practical, hands-on experience through projects and internships, which is what truly prepares me for a professional role.' },
        { id: 'hr15', question: 'How do you define success?', answer: 'To me, success is a combination of achieving professional goals and having a positive impact on a team or a project. For instance, successfully developing the Magno Charge prototype was a success because it solved a real-world problem and was the result of effective teamwork and collaboration.' },
        { id: 'hr16', question: 'What are your hobbies?', answer: 'I enjoy staying updated with the latest technological developments and participating in coding hackathons, like the Shastra 1.0 Coding Hackathon where I was a finalist. I also have a keen interest in learning new programming languages and frameworks in my free time.' },
        { id: 'hr17', question: 'What is your greatest failure?', answer: 'During a hackathon, my team and I decided to take on a very ambitious project with a new technology that none of us had much experience with. We were so focused on the novelty that we failed to build a solid foundation, and the project ultimately didn\'t work. I learned the importance of balancing ambition with a realistic assessment of my team\'s skills and the project timeline.' },
        { id: 'hr18', question: 'What kind of work environment do you prefer?', answer: 'I thrive in a dynamic, collaborative environment where I can both contribute my skills and learn from experienced colleagues. I appreciate a culture that encourages innovation and continuous learning, much like the one I experienced during my internships.' },
        { id: 'hr19', question: 'What is your leadership style?', answer: 'While I am still early in my career, I believe in leading by example. I am a strong believer in transparent communication and giving everyone a voice in decision-making. My role in the Magno Charge project involved contributing to the team\'s success through collaborative problem-solving, which I believe is a key aspect of effective leadership.' },
        { id: 'hr20', question: 'How do you handle a tight deadline?', answer: 'When faced with a tight deadline, I first break down the project into smaller tasks and prioritize them. I then work to complete the most critical tasks first. If needed, I would communicate with my team or manager to manage expectations and ensure that everyone is aligned on the priorities to meet the deadline.' },
        { id: 'hr21', question: 'Tell me more about the "Magno Charge" project and its impact.', answer: 'The "Magno Charge" project was a Bluetooth smart charger prototype I developed with a team. It was funded with ₹4.8 Lakhs from IIT Bombay\'s TIH-IoT Foundation. The main goal was to address battery overcharging. The prototype was designed to theoretically reduce overcharge risk by ~85% and extend battery lifespan by 12-24%.'},

The derived class inherits the properties and behaviors of the base class, promoting code reusability and establishing an "is-a" relationship between classes.' },
            { id: 'cpp2', question: 'What is a virtual function in C++?', answer: 'A virtual function is a member function of a class that is declared with the `virtual` keyword.

This means that even on a multi-core processor, only one thread can be executing Python bytecode at any given time, limiting true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks.' },
            { id: 'py2', question: 'What is the difference between `list` and `tuple` in Python?', answer: 'A `list` is a mutable sequence of objects, meaning its elements can be changed, added, or removed after creation. A `tuple` is an immutable sequence of objects, so its elements cannot be changed after it is created. Tuples are generally more memory-efficient and faster to process.' },
            { id: 'py3', question: 'Can you tell me about the Python-based ML Sentiment Analyzer prototype you developed?', answer: 'As part of my virtual internship at SkillDzire, I developed a Python-based ML Sentiment Analyzer prototype.

            { id: 'dbms1', question: 'What is indexing in a database and why is it important?', answer: 'Indexing is a technique used to retrieve data from a database more quickly. It works by creating a data structure (like a B-tree) on one or more columns of a table or collection, allowing the database engine to quickly locate records without scanning the entire data set. This significantly improves query performance.' },

It is an independent entity with its own memory space. A thread, on the other hand, is a unit of execution within a process. Threads of the same process share the same memory space, making them "lightweight" and more efficient for concurrent tasks.' },
