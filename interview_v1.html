I also stay active on platforms like GitHub to see what new technologies and projects are emerging.' },
        { id: 'hr12', question: 'How do you handle conflict in a team?', answer: 'I believe open and respectful communication is key. I would first try to understand the other person\'s perspective by listening carefully. Then, I would propose a solution-oriented discussion to find common ground and resolve the issue constructively, always keeping the project\'s success as the primary goal.' },
        { id: 'hr13', question: 'Tell me about your most successful project.', answer: 'My most successful project has been "Magno Charge," an intelligent auto disconnect charger. My team and I secured â‚¹4.8 Lakhs in funding from IIT Bombay\'s TIH-IoT Foundation. We developed a Bluetooth-enabled prototype to address the problem of battery overcharging. The success wasn\'t just in the funding, but in the collaborative problem-solving and tangible results we achieved as a team.' },
        { id: 'hr14', question: 'What is your GPA and what does it say about you?', answer: 'My GPA is 7.9/10, which corresponds to 75%. I believe it reflects a strong foundation in my academic studies. However, I believe my resume shows that I am not just focused on academics, but also on practical, hands-on experience through projects and internships, which is what truly prepares me for a professional role.' },
        { id: 'hr15', question: 'How do you define success?', answer: 'To me, success is a combination of achieving professional goals and having a positive impact on a team or a project. For instance, successfully developing the Magno Charge prototype was a success because it solved a real-world problem and was the result of effective teamwork and collaboration.' },
        { id: 'hr16', question: 'What are your hobbies?', answer: 'I enjoy staying updated with the latest technological developments and participating in coding hackathons, like the Shastra 1.0 Coding Hackathon where I was a finalist. I also have a keen interest in learning new programming languages and frameworks in my free time.' },
        { id: 'hr17', question: 'What is your greatest failure?', answer: 'During a hackathon, my team and I decided to take on a very ambitious project with a new technology that none of us had much experience with. We were so focused on the novelty that we failed to build a solid foundation, and the project ultimately didn\'t work. I learned the importance of balancing ambition with a realistic assessment of my team\'s skills and the project timeline.' },
        { id: 'hr18', question: 'What kind of work environment do you prefer?', answer: 'I thrive in a dynamic, collaborative environment where I can both contribute my skills and learn from experienced colleagues. I appreciate a culture that encourages innovation and continuous learning, much like the one I experienced during my internships.' },
        { id: 'hr19', question: 'What is your leadership style?', answer: 'While I am still early in my career, I believe in leading by example. I am a strong believer in transparent communication and giving everyone a voice in decision-making. My role in the Magno Charge project involved contributing to the team\'s success through collaborative problem-solving, which I believe is a key aspect of effective leadership.' },
        { id: 'hr20', question: 'How do you handle a tight deadline?', answer: 'When faced with a tight deadline, I first break down the project into smaller tasks and prioritize them. I then work to complete the most critical tasks first. If needed, I would communicate with my team or manager to manage expectations and ensure that everyone is aligned on the priorities to meet the deadline.' },
        { id: 'hr21', question: 'Tell me more about the "Magno Charge" project and its impact.', answer: 'The "Magno Charge" project was a Bluetooth smart charger prototype I developed with a team. It was funded with â‚¹4.8 Lakhs from IIT Bombay\'s TIH-IoT Foundation. The main goal was to address battery overcharging. The prototype was designed to theoretically reduce overcharge risk by ~85% and extend battery lifespan by 12-24%.'},

This means that even on a multi-core processor, only one thread can be executing Python bytecode at any given time, limiting true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks.' },
            { id: 'py2', question: 'What is the difference between `list` and `tuple` in Python?', answer: 'A `list` is a mutable sequence of objects, meaning its elements can be changed, added, or removed after creation. A `tuple` is an immutable sequence of objects, so its elements cannot be changed after it is created. Tuples are generally more memory-efficient and faster to process.' },
            { id: 'py3', question: 'Can you tell me about the Python-based ML Sentiment Analyzer prototype you developed?', answer: 'As part of my virtual internship at SkillDzire, I developed a Python-based ML Sentiment Analyzer prototype.

It works by creating a data structure (like a B-tree) on one or more columns of a table or collection, allowing the database engine to quickly locate records without scanning the entire data set. This significantly improves query performance.' },

It is an independent entity with its own memory space. A thread, on the other hand, is a unit of execution within a process. Threads of the same process share the same memory space, making them "lightweight" and more efficient for concurrent tasks.' },
